    <h1>Chapati</h1>

        <img src="../images/chapati.jpg" alt="A bowl of Chapati"/>

    <h3>Kenyan Chapati is a soft, flaky, chewy flatbread that is a staple part of celebratory meals in Kenya and other East African Countries. Popularly known as “chapo” in Kenya, it is usually enjoyed with curries as a main meal, with tea or eggs for breakfast.</h3>

        <p>Kenyan Chapati is not the same as the Indian chapati. Indian chapati is also known as roti in many parts of India. Kenyan Chapati is more like the flaky parathas.</p>
