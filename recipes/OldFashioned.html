    <h2>The recipe dates back to the early 1800s, before the words classic and cocktail were even said next to each other.</h2>

        <p>The Old Fashioned gets its name because it started as literally the cocktail. Thats right: the first cocktail in existence! The definition of the word cocktail was first documented in 1806 in a New York paper The Balance and Columbian Repository, calling it a “concoction of spirits, bitters, water, and sugar,” essentially a recipe for an Old Fashioned.</p>

        <p>Once more cocktails came along in the 1880s, they needed a name for that original whiskey cocktail. The “Old Fashioned” was born.</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bourbon or rye whiskey</li>
            <li>Sugar cube</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Angostura bitters</li>
            <li>Orange peel</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>STEPS FOR PREPARATION</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Shake 4 dashes bitters on 1 sugar cube, then muddle it with  ½ teaspoon of water</li>
            <li>Add 2 ounces of whiskey</li>
            <li>Add ice, orange peel, and optional cherry</li>
                <p>Orange peel: Squeeze it over the drink first, which releases the oils and gives it a strong orange perfume. Then run the orange peel around the rim of the glass to give an even more citrusy first sip.</p>
                <p>Cocktail cherry: The cherry adds a nuanced sweetness to this cocktail. Determine if youd like your Old Fashioned on the sweeter side.</p>
                <p>
                    Lemon peel: A lemon peel can also be an optional garnish for an Old Fashioned, along with the orange peel.</p>
        </ol>
